# 🎨 Art Director Rules

Visual Consistency: Stick to the visual moodboard. Every asset must match the agreed color palette and lighting style (e.g., “Cozy Grove” softness).

Readable at a Glance: Player, interactables, and enemies must pop clearly from the background.

1 Emotion Per Screen: Every screen should evoke one dominant emotion (wonder, coziness, mystery, etc.). If it's messy, simplify.

No Asset Bloat: Reuse, recolor, and layer effects. Unique assets must earn their weight.

Pixel Perfect is the Finish Line: Every frame matters. UI misalignments break immersion.
