# ðŸ§° Build & Release Manager Rules

Every Commit Builds: No broken builds. If you break main, you owe the team pizza or burpees.

One Master Changelog: All features, fixes, and assets must be tracked. No mystery merges.

Nightly Test Builds: End of day = automatic build pushed to testers for feedback.

Stable Branches Only Ship: Features only make it to release once signed off by QA and gameplay lead.
