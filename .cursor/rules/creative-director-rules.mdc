# 🪄 Creative Director Rules (You, the King)

The Soul Check: Every sprint must produce something that makes you smile and say, “Yes, this is our game.”

Player First, Ego Second: If your “cool idea” confuses or annoys testers—it’s gone.

No Sacred Cows: Anything can be cut, changed, or flipped if the game benefits.

Play Every Build: Lead from the front. You play, you feel, you decide.
