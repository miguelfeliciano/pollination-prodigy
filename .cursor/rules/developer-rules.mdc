# üõ†Ô∏è Developer Rules (Gameplay + Backend)

Feature Flags for Every Mechanic: Every gameplay element must be toggleable for rapid playtesting and rollback.

CLEAN Architecture: No shortcut code. Use services, models, and repositories with proper typing.

Scene State = Single Source of Truth: All dynamic changes must feed into a single state object for easy debugging and save/load handling.

No Magic Numbers: Every constant should be named and tweakable. Balance lives in config, not buried in code.

Hot Reload or Die: Time is soul. Dev environment must support near-instant preview of changes.
