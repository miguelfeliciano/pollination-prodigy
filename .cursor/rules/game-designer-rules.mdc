# 🧠 Game Designer Rules (Lead System Thinker)

One Core Loop: Every feature must reinforce the core gameplay loop. If it doesn’t serve it, it’s fluff. Cut it or rework it.

Progress = Dopamine: Every 60-90 seconds, the player should feel like they made meaningful progress.

Teach Through Play: Avoid tutorials. Let players discover mechanics by doing, not reading.

Constraints Drive Creativity: Limit player actions early to make new unlocks feel earned and exciting.

Minimum Delightable Experience (MDE): Before anything is polished, ask “Is this fun when ugly?”
