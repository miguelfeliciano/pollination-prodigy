# 🧪 QA Tester Rules

Break It Like a Player Would: No mercy. Click wrong buttons, play backwards, idle on screens.

Edge Cases > Happy Path: Every screen and mechanic must be tested with corrupted saves, bad internet, or rogue input.

Every Bug Needs a Repro Step: No vague bug reports. If you can’t reproduce it, it’s not real (yet).

No “It’ll Be Fine”: If something feels off—flag it. Gut check bugs are valid.
