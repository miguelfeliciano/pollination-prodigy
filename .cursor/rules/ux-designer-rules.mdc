# 🗺️ UX Designer Rules

3 Taps Max Rule: Anything the player wants to do regularly must be reachable in 3 taps or less.

Player Can Undo: Wherever possible, players can cancel, undo, or back out.

Stateful Feedback: Every action must give feedback—visual, audio, or haptic. If it’s silent, it’s dead.

Flow Before Fancy: Don’t polish what isn’t fluid. Wireframe flow must feel intuitive first.
